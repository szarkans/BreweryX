> [!IMPORTANT]
> Brewery**X** is based off of an over **decade** old plugin called Brewery. A lot of this code is old and awful to look at. If you see poorly written code, don't assume the worst because chances are, I didn't even write it. Thanks


### Brewery is a Plugin for an alternate brewing process, including alcoholic Potions.
s
Works with Spigot, Paper, and Folia from `1.21.1` to `1.8.x`!

The somewhat difficult brewing process rewards you with a diversity of Potions, which, through their effects, create a drunkenness that has never existed in Minecraft before.
